# Autonomous_Fruit_Plucking_Robot
Implementation of Autonomous fruit plucking Robot  with gripper using FIREBIRD V
The agriculture industry is demanding technological solutions focused on
automating agriculture tasks in order to increase the production and benefits while
reducing time and costs. These technological solutions are mostly based on the
application of sensor-based technologies.
The main aim of this project is to overcome the major problems faced by the fruit
harvesters. Fruits are damaged due to falling on the ground while plucking from the tree.
Another problem is shortage of skilled labor due to which the harvester is unable to
harvest the fruits at right time. As a result, the fruits may get over-ripened and becomes
useless which also results in loss to fruit harvesters.
This Project helps to prevent stated problems by designing an intelligent robot
(Firebird V) which plucks and picks fruits from the trees in the garden and carries to the
required place and dumps in a specified place. The robot moves throughout the fruit
garden and senses all areas of the tree using IR sensors to pluck and pick fruits, having
similar shape and size without damaging the fruits and other parts of tree like branches,
leaves etc.
